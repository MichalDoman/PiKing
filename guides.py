In the chapters list, among other more or less interesting (however, all equally time-consuming to write) chapters, you will find a guide on how to start working on your Mnemonic Major System and use it to start memorising long number sequences. This chapter, however, focuses on all the technical details regarding tools and widgets that Pi King has to offer. '
